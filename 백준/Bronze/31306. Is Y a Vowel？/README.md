### 문제 설명

<p>The Vowels are <strong>a</strong>, <strong>e</strong>, <strong>i</strong>, <strong>o</strong> and <strong>u</strong>, and possibly <strong>y</strong>. People disagree on whether <strong>y</strong> is a vowel or not. Unfortunately for you, you have been tasked with counting the number of vowels in a word. You'll have to count how many vowels there are assuming <strong>y</strong> is a vowel, and assuming <strong>y</strong> is not.</p>

### 입력

### 출력 

 <p>Output two space-separated integers. The first is the number of vowels assuming <strong>y</strong> is not a vowel, the second is the number of vowels assuming <strong>y</strong> is a vowel.</p>
