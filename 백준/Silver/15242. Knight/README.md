### 문제 설명

<p>In Chess, the knight is the weirdest of all the pieces. To begin with, the piece is actually a horse without any human riding it. The second reason is its movement pattern. It can move 2 cells forward and one to the side. Below you can see all the possible destinations of a knight.</p>

<p>With a movement pattern so weird, it is complicated to know what’s the shortest path between two board squares. Can you write a program that computes the minimum number of movements needed to move a knight from one square to another? Remember that a chessboard has 8 rows and 8 columns. Also in the standard notation, the columns are represented by letters from a to h.</p>
