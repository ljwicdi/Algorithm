### 문제 설명

<p>A prison has been built as a labyrinth.</p>

<p>The labyrinth is composed of huts labelled + or *. If you are in hut +, you can only move to another hut + near your hut. One hut is considered near one another if the two huts have a side in common. If you are in hut *, you can only move to another hut * near your hut.</p>

<p>The labyrinth can be seen as a rectangle of huts of width W and length L. W and L are integers.</p>

<p>A hut is identified by its position on the horizontal side and by its position on the vertical side of the labyrinth.</p>

<p>In this prison, all huts are “entry huts” but there is only one “exit hut”.</p>

<p>Given the labyrinth, the hut of the prisoner (called entry hut) and the exit hut, your task is to determine if the prisoner can escape.</p>

<p>In the example of Prison A (labyrinth of length 4 and width 2), the prisoner can escape. In the second example (labyrinth of length 3 and width 2), the prisoner cannot escape.</p>
